specific for i3 wm


this program require: emacs, i3, xclip

to install, create a file 'ec.sh', and insert into it the text under the ec.sh section


add the text under the 'i3 config' section to your i3 config (changing variables as needed), and add the text under the 'emacs init.el' section to your emacs configuration.
